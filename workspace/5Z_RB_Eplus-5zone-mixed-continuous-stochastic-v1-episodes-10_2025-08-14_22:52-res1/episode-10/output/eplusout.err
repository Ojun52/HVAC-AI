   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** RunPeriod: object=RUNPERIOD 1, start weekday (TUESDAY) does not match the start year (2024), corrected to MONDAY.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 5 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ************* Beginning System Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** GetPollutionFactorInput: Requested reporting for Carbon Equivalent Pollution, but insufficient information is entered.
   **   ~~~   ** Both "FuelFactors" and "EnvironmentalImpactFactors" must be entered or the displayed carbon pollution will all be zero.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
